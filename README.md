# Autonomous-Pothole-Detection-and-Mapping-Vehicle

Autonomous Pothole Detection and Mapping Vehicle is an autonomous and efficient robotic system that uses sensors, GPS, and Arduino and can operate in urban environments with the primary goal of identifying and avoiding potholes. Potholes are a common and persistent issue on roads in many urban areas, causing significant damage to vehicles, posing safety hazards to drivers and pedestrians, and contributing to the deterioration of road
infrastructure.

**Open structure model of Autonomous Pothole Detection, Avoiding and Mapping Vehicle**

Currently this model uses black lines to provide itself direction. GPS module is not present currently in the model but there is a possibility of its addition in future. It avoids the black line(using an IR sensor) when detects a pothole using ultrasonic sensors and uses the code to automatically direct it towards the black line after detecting the pothole.
